    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Over the period of the last 11 years, YOU have taken Computer Zone from a simple business idea to a revolution in the heart of Pakistan’s Information Technology market. The idea behind the development of Computer Zone was never about creating a retailer with good prices; but to give birth to a place where people could be served as a part of the family. Where they could actually feel the touch of Information Technology’s application in the way they are dealt with. The world has moved to the next generation of business relationships; and we are proud to be the first in Pakistan’s Information Technology market to accept that “Yes, YOU are important!” With around 1,000% growth rate, we are proud and extremely happy to quote that Computer Zone has a family of approximately 40,000 (and growing) online family members and more than 60,000 (and growing) customer’s offline; in comparison to a total of 10 customers 11 years ago. The world is changing and Computer Zone happily accepts that the customers of today are more tech savvy and demand value for their money. We believe that change is the only thing constant and in order to deliver to you the value you deserve, we are always in the process of evolving to the next best level.</p>
